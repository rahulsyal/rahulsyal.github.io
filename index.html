<h1>Rahul's Little Corner of the Internet</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Rahul Syal, and I am a Computer Science major entering my sophomore year at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. I have lived most of my life in Brick, New Jersey. This summer, I will be working with Girls Who Code in Newark, NJ (host partner - Verizon). For those of you unaware of the organization, the mission of the nonprofit is to achieve gender parity in computing fields. Gender parity used to be much closer than it is today, but the divide has grown. By the year 2020, there will be 1.4 million new jobs in computing fields, but only 400,000 college graduates to fill the positions. A small fraction of those graduates are female. By introducing programming to younger girls in high school and providing an intensive summer immersion program in a collaborative, project-based classroom, the goal is to have more of these young women to consider a career in Computer Science.  Most girls are nervous about entering the male-dominated field, so the program provides valuable assurance that girls indeed are capable of having an incredible career in Computer Science. Alongside teaching Computer Science, the girls are also taught soft skills - presenting, networking, communicating, etc. By familiarizing and perfecting their soft skills, their self-confidence radiates motivation to themselves and those around them.<br> <br>
